Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
I think the main issue is that you aren't directly addressing the problem caused with the collision i.e. there's no guarantee that resizing once will solve the collision, you're basically going by luck of the draw, at least with how we were hashing the index in this part.  
It is apparent that bucketing i.e. a 2d array would be a more direct approach.
